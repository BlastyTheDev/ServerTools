Just random stuff that might help, or just be cool for minecraft

**Planned Features**

- Chat messages being sent to discord, using discord bot and webhooks
- Crash command that crash players client (somehow if possible) (Delayed)
- /Vanish
- Configuration

Note that this plugin requires a discord bot, and one is not provided, to use it, create your own bot in the discord developer portal and ensure that is has permission to create webhooks and send messages, for simplicity just give it admin. If you don't do this, the plugin may run slower or spam a bunch of error after every message. Or just turn off the discord intergration.
